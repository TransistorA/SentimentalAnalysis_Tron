@jasra thanks! it turned into a very crazy but good day.
i want to post an angry angsty status but there's a little voice in my head saying "let it go." gonna listen to that voice today. #fb
@jennifer_brandt can't stand the mushy kissy-face updates! who are they trying to convince?
@bluejena the 8th visit? become mayor & get 15% off any item? that sort of thing? we're talking the animal rescue league so we're limited
@bluejena ok, as my foursquare expert =) do you think it would increase foot traffic to a place if they offered $ off in their store for say
would you go somewhere and check-in because of an offer? please, educate me on this!
does this mean it's not worth doing? what makes you check-in somewhere? when do you check-in? do incentives (discounts, etc) make a diff?
okay, so i'm trying out foursquare for a possible work project  and have forgotten to check-in to anyplace i've been in the last 4 days...
@jasra i cannot more highly recommend the nook. we have 2 regular nooks and a color nook and have never had an issue with any of them, evah.
