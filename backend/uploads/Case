The recipe seemed overly complex for a few shreds of veggie. I don't really understand.
I just saw a "Chocolate Zucchini Bread" recipe that was a bunch of butter, chocolate chips, and flour. Why don't you just eat cake?

@MikeGraySC Saw some at stub hub this weekend and regretting not getting one.
I'm not and glad I'm not. The friends who I'd hit up Hollywood with aren't. That's gotta be a stale email list.
How good do they think this list is? Are the people who wanted to party on a Hollywood rooftop 10 yrs ago still interested in the same again
And are playing the same place from like 08. Didn't know that was still a hot place to go. But let's go back to this mailing list.
So now like 8-9 years later, these guys resurrected their old mailing list (I haven't rsvped since like 09).
I used to RSVP occasionally but never went because like I had a job, and weeknight clubbing is way different from week night bar-ing
Back in the late aughts, they DJed/promoted the Hollywood pretty people hotel bars and clubs. They had a guest list.
I just got an email from the EC Twins and I was transported to 2008. Then I snapped back and was like "whoa, they're still doing stuff?"

@ElleJayCee_ @LAGalaxyOUTSDR based on the seat, he flys like the masses (or at least the masses who can afford business but not 1st)
I can't even. Took all the joy out of shopping
She then goes finds another cart with someone else's stuff, takes it all out, and then puts her things in it.
Asshat (who has an actual hat in her cart) proceeds to complain while I stand over my cart waiting for her to remove her crap.
I asked for my cart back "you know to didn't have to say anything." And so come out my "really?" Face and "I'd like my cart back."
this asshat took all the crap out of my basket while I was in the fitting room, &amp; took the cart. She pointed me to where she left my stuff
Bought one swimsuit for my vacation. Please validate my decision to get one more
Why did I expect anything other than an upset stomach after eating at a place called "Belly Bombz?"
So what number is Sebastian Lletget wearing for the USA?
@popphysique If I buy a package can I use it at multiple studios like Studio City one day and HLP on another with the same package?

@dwyercd you're here. Why you missing us?
@OsoFresh138 What, when?
I feel like I should be pumping Iron at a Miami gym in the late 80s thanks to this MSNBC "live stream will return shortly" music.
@AdrianAmler Oh man, always wanted to visit Grenoble
Every time I get to the mail bag portion of @ExtraTimeRadio I get flashback to hour two of my old commute.
RT @FutbolIntellect: Punish the Timbers for trash banter. https://t.co/5JQMVQyguc
I just gotta keep telling myself that $125 is more than I'd like t spend to see @bssmusic's return and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers
My coworker brought me chocolate. I'm now eating my feelings about June.
Like those are legit tears in my eyes.
.@bssmusic is playing my birthday weekend but I work that day and am not allowed to take time off in June. Teaaaarrrrssss.
Well, temp has dropped 20 degrees and now I want something warm and healthy not cool and light for dinner :(
The Bride on this episode of Say Yes to the Dress just said "yugeee." I do not like her now.
It's a gorgeous day. Tonight's dinner of baba ganoush and chicken wraps are perfect for this weather https://t.co/8D4lj6beQt
@seanCduregger ah the great minds of our generation.
@seanCduregger I feel like I missed something. Is that picking up steam because of our government?
Yeah, no regrets. It was followed up with Bush and Radiohead. https://t.co/3pdczmLEg4
The cost of tickets for this G2 game were pretty high. #LAvPOR
@galacticla is this a truck or a mostly permanent stand?
@GalaxyPodcast no he wasn't great, but he's also the best we've got. It seems like the panic button was hit before game 2 even kicked off
@ch I don't think I'd describe myself as "patient" if I leave a review for inconsistency after one night with kitchen issues
@galacticla hey did you ever get your tickets to work on stub hub?
@GalaxyPodcast so when we see Diop isn't ready and bring back Rowe, will his confidence be shaken because the coach had none in him?
Anyone else's barcodes for today's @LAGalaxy game didn't work when trying to list on stub hub?
I'm just continuously yelling "Johnson!" "Wood!" at my TV. The life of a U.S Soccer fan this sunday morning.  #HSVBMG #USMNT
@DeNeil10 Who knew windows NT still exist?!
@jrkumor cool. We want to book on our own, but have the escorts of AO. But I guess we can always hire a car too.
My shorts just became office appropriate because I went into work wearing them today.
@HighOnCaps @actuallybbottei @magee18 This thread has made my day.
@jrkumor then you are the perfect person to talk to. How did it feel getting to and from the game safety wise?
@jrkumor Gracias! Do you know the hotel by any chance? I was half asleep last night.
@jrkumor hey do you remember where AO stood in Mexico for the last WCQ?
@OsoFresh138 It looked good in the photo I saw. Never realized how bad it could be.
@galacticla @OsoFresh138 I always thought it was the clumpyness, but no, it's everything.
Made Cottage Cheese Chocolate Pudding and wow, is it not tasty.
@ElleJayCee_ Not bad. I'd eat a good portion of that. IT seems like it's a lot like Veggie Grill,
@ElleJayCee_ It's one of those places with fake meats and cheeses, right? I actually dig those fake meats a lot.
Anyone have other vegan restaurant suggestions? Preferably Westside? 

I'm so excited about cheeseless salads and meals.
Like, this is the first menu I've seen in ages where I was like "I'd eat at least half this stuff with no modifications!" That's a big deal
I've always rolled my eyes at Vegan restaurants, but I just went through Cafe Gratitude's menu and it look perfect for this picky eater.

1st trip to Jersey Mike's. The manager informed all of us after we paid the wait for hot sandwiches is 20 mins. Too long for a lunch break
@LAGalaxy I got 2 STMs at my house. Can you send a player over to surprise us?
@anHedonismBot a classic
Grinning ear to ear because I heard there was a Dog on the Pitch moment today.
@OsoFresh138 whaaa? this year's?
Looks like Juninho is still an option for 2017 Galaxy jerseys https://t.co/8IgORYYirh
Woo! I was one of the #Dress4MLS winners. Thanks @MLS, I could use a @jelle_van_damme jersey
@1morequietnight It's a super tone deaf statement though.
Think I just got a phishing like text right now.
@AJSorrell_ SERIOUSLY! I called that out in a work meeting once. "Do I need a cutesy font customization for my phone? No, b/c I'm an adult"
So a buffer row would have stopped them from stealing a seat and beating a cop? Ok cool. https://t.co/wtEtpL3sAq
@TotalMLS Wow. What a clueless bunch üôÑ

@adra21 How's it going today? So I'm pretty busy this week. But I do want to try going in the mornings before work (maybe the venice one)
@adra21 I love Pop Physique but it is super hard! Want to buddy up and try again?
Tell me there is a draw for GOld Cup and I find myself watching.
@mikegomez @InDieRoq I want that.
A week late, but damnit Nashville. #allthetears https://t.co/xGzTkPTZhs
I'm so sad. Bay Cities Deli is closed on mondays.
So maybe the exceptions on Atlanta were a wee bit high?

Now there is some ad/commerical playing under the #PORvMIN broadcast? Way low rent. Get it together.
That was some low rent MLS coverage there. #PORvMIN
Glad I turned on the #USMNT U20 game  just in time for some ace CONCACAF-iness
@galacticla It's annoying aaand funny. It's legit both.
@galacticla or it's the play five plays ago where nothing happened Everyone gets excited to see the foul, instead it's a long ball clip
@GalaxyPodcast Know what would be nice? Restroom floors that don't double as slip n' slides.
@galacticla meeeehhhhh. I would have liked it more when I was still sitting on the endline and had to turn around for replays

@DannyPage I thought it was a gym commandment that they must show Friends at all times.
Finally is see them filming Damce Mom's at Abby lee Dance LA! I drive past it every day and never see them filming!
@valaxie @ElleJayCee_ they had a pair of the good ones last week for $3.
@ElleJayCee_ no. you don't buy a swimsuit at costco.
Fredy Montero is back #VANvNY
@ElleJayCee_ dude. You're a single woman. What do you need at Costco that you can't get at Vons in normal person quantities?
@elJGY oh that's good! Way better than going more inland
@elJGY where did you end up choosing?
@gypsyxfade can I bring like a drink or smoothie with me?
@gypsyxfade noted. Let's do this
